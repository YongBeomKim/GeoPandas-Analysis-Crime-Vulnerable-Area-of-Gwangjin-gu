# GeoPandas-Analysis-Crime-Rate-of-Gwangjin-gu
This project was done when I was second-year student.
The reason why I upload this project now is that I started GitHub recently.

## The Goal
The goal is to know the crime vulnerable area in the Gwangjin-gu. Furthermore, We want to learn how to handle spatial data such as shapefile and geometry.

## Method
- We can know the crime valnerable area using CCTV installation rate.
- So in this project, we get all of the CCTV installation poi data and location of police office in Gwangjin-gu and buffer about 1km of those police office to size the security.
- Union those area and difference from Gwangjin-gu area.
- We can see the vulnerable area, and that will be the area we should be concerned.

## Analysis Process

1. Visualization crime&arrest rate of each police office around the Gwangjin-gu.
2.
